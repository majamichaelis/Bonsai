# Bonsai
7.Semester, Vertiefung 3D-Modellierung:

As part of my studies, I took a specialization module on 3D modeling and completed a fascinating project. The task was to focus on a specific object, model, texture and animate it and then present it in an interactive scene. The application I developed is available for both MacOS and Windows and focuses on my 3D model, the Bonsai. All assets were modeled and textured by me personally to create a unique visual experience.
The application is designed to be interactive and allows users to explore and control the bonsai model using arrow keys, mouse movements and mouse clicks. In addition, camera movements are used to present my bonsai. Autodesk Maya 3D was used for modeling and animation and Adobe Substance Painter for texturing. The interactive 3D application was created using Unity 3D.
